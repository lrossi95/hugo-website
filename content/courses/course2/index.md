# Summary

In this course, students learn how to conduct exploratory data analysis to summarize and visualize complex datasets, frame and articulate economic and policy-related problems clearly, and critically assess the impact of policies using econometric techniques. By the end of the course, students will be adept at applying these skills to make informed decisions and contribute effectively to policy evaluation and economic strategy development.

# Detailed Course Outline

## Introduction

The course begins by introducing graduate students in engineering to the fundamental concepts of econometrics, emphasizing practical applications in their field. It aims to develop competency in the following key areas:

	1.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
	•	Techniques for summarizing main characteristics of data, often with visual methods.
	•	Understanding data distributions, variability, and presence of outliers.
	•	Preparing data for econometric modeling through cleaning and transformation processes.
	2.	Econometric Analysis:
	•	Application of statistical and econometric methods to evaluate the effectiveness of policies.
	•	Introduction to regression models, hypothesis testing, and causal inference.
	•	Using econometric software (STATA) as well as programming languages (R and Python) to perform analyses and interpret the outputs.
	3.	Presentation of Findings:
	•	Effective communication of econometric findings to both technical and non-technical audiences.
	•	Development of visualizations to represent data and econometric results clearly.
	•	Crafting comprehensive reports and presentations that summarize research methodology, analysis, and recommendations.

## Course Learning Objectives

	•	Develop Analytical Skills: Enhance ability to critically analyze economic and policy issues using quantitative methods.
	•	Problem Solving: Apply econometric tools to investigate and solve policy-related problems.
	•	Decision Making: Utilize data-driven insights to inform strategic decisions in policy and business contexts.

## Methodology

The course employs a combination of lectures, hands-on labs, and project work. Students will engage with real-world datasets, applying their learned skills to assess policy impacts in various sectors. Assessments include problem sets, exams, and a capstone project where students will conduct a full econometric analysis from data gathering to presenting findings.

## Target Audience

This course is ideal for graduate students in engineering who are interested in applying quantitative analysis to policy and economic research. It is also suitable for professionals in economics, public policy, and related fields seeking to upgrade their econometric skills.

By integrating theoretical knowledge with practical skills, this course prepares students to tackle complex challenges in their professional careers, armed with powerful tools to influence decision-making processes effectively.
